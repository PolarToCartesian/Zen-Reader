# Easy Read

Have you ever found yourself zooming-ing to see better but you were still straining your eyes and you felt that the website was made even harder to use? If so, you know as well as I do that the web can be difficult to use if you have poor eyesight. In order to resolve this issue once and for all (I hope so), I have created a chrome extension that makes interfaces clearer to use, links distinguishable from other text, and increases the contrast between the background and the text without changing the appearence of images! You can download it now or wait until I publish it for free. This extension works for all Chromium browsers (Google Chrome, Opera, ..., and Microsoft Edge in the future) as well as Firefox!
